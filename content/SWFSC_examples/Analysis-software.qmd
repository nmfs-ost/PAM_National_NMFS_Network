title: SAEL Acoustic Software 
---

The Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab has focused effort on developing a streamlined approach to passive acoustic data analysis that relies an Open Science approach, including a reliance on open-source software.

## PAMpal

PAMpal is an R package for processing passive acoustic data. Currently PAMpal only supports data collected using PAMGuard ([pamguard.org](pamguard.org)), but in the future we hope to support other platforms. *PAMmisc is a collaboration between Taiki Sakai (SWFSC) and Shannon Rankin, with the help of numerous partners, and was funded by NOAA's Advanced Sampling Technology Working Group.*

-   PAMpal Github (<https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PAMpal>)

In addition, we have developed these R software packages to address other needs:

## PAMmisc

A collection of miscellaneous functions for passive acoustics (much of the content is adapted from R code written by other people). *PAMmisc is a collaboration between Taiki Sakai (SWFSC) and Shannon Rankin, and was funded by NOAA's Advanced Sampling Technology Working Group.*

## BANTER

BANTER is a hierarchical species classifier for acoustic events developed using multiple call type detectors (see [Rankin et al. 2017](doi:10.1111/mms.12381)). Banter User's Guide available [here](https://taikisan21.github.io/PAMpal/banterGuide.html). Banter was originally developed for dolphins, but has also been applied to beaked whales ([Rankin et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102511)), among other species. *BANTER was developed by a collaboration between Shannon Rankin (SWFSC) and Eric Archer (SWFSC) and was funded by NOAA's Ocean Acoustics Program.*

## PAMscapes

A variety of tools relevant to the analysis of marine soundscape data (including tools for downloading AIS data from [Marine Cadastre](https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/), connecting AIS data to GPS coordinates, plotting summaries of various soundscape measurements, and downloading relevant environmental variables (wind, swell height) from the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/). *PAMscapes development was a collaboration between Shannon Rankin (SWFSC), Taiki Sakai (SWFSC), Anne Simonis (SWFSC), and Megan McKenna (National Marine Sanctuary Foundation); funding provided by NOAA's Ocean Acoustics Program.*

## Driftwatch

Driftwatch was developed to help with tracking of drifting acoustic buoys using satellite GPS. The basic code is available on Github, but there are a number of steps required to get it to function for outside use. *Driftwatch was developed by Taiki Sakai and was funded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (Inter-Agency Agreement G14-M20PG00013).*
