## Local Data Archive

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES data are locally stored on shared servers/drives.

All raw data and current analysis for ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES can be found on the DON

(\\swc-storage4-s\MMTD-ACOUSTICS)

All archived projects and a copy of ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES SUD files can be found on the PAM Synology arrays (\\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam, \\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam2)

## NCEI Data Archive

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL raw data is publicly accessible through [NCEI Passive Acoustics Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data). Sound level metrics can also be accessed from this archive.

All data were packaged using a combination of automated scripts and the NCEI Passive Packer tool. Several automation scripts were used to create Passive Packer ready databases from our deployment details metadata. Detailed methods can be found [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/NCEI.html).

## Tethys

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES deployment metadata and detection data are archived in our lab's [Tethys database](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/). See [Tethys SAEL GitHub repository](https://github.com/asimonis/TethysSAEL) and our [detailed methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/TethysDeployments.html) for more information.

## OBIS Seamap
