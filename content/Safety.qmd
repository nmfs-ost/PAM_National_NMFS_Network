### Lithium Ion Batteries

This document will serve as a working draft for the management of lithium batteries. The following bullet points are the ones we discussed today, please feel free to add or make changes to any section according to NOAA, OMAO, and the State of California regulations.

#### **SWFSC Li Battery Management**

1.  **Purpose**

    The intent of this document is to provide employees and contractors of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFCS) with guidelines that will allow personnel to safely handle, ship, store, dispose of, and respond to Lithium (Li) and Li-ion battery emergency situations.

    Extreme caution must be exercised when managing Li and Li-ion batteries within the center or conducting field operations due to the potential for fire, damage, or injury to personnel or property if misused or improperly handled. To prevent injury, it is imperative that employers and employees understand the basic function, hazards and safe use of Li and Li-ion battery powered devices.

2.  **Procurement**

    Li and Li-batteries can cause injury if they have design defects, are made of low quality materials, are assembled incorrectly, are used or recharged improperly, or are damaged during shipment or handling by the consumer. When purchasing Li batteries please use the following best practices guidelines. While the list is not exhaustive, it provides SWFCS the ability to ensure that the Li batteries purchased are of the highest quality available:

    A.  Purchase batteries from a reputable manufacturer, supplier, or use a preferred supplier

    B.  Ensure that the batteries are tested in accordance with an OSHA recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NLTR) and meet industry standards

    C.  Avoid batteries that have been shipped without protective packaging (i.e., hard plastic casing or similar protective measures)

    D.  Inspect batteries upon receipt and safely dispose of damaged batteries

    E.  Check to ensure that a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) particular to the battery ordered has been shipped alongside the batteries; store this in a binder accessible to those with access with the Li or Li-ion batteries

    F.  Do not over purchase in size or volume

3.  **Handling**

    Observe the following guidelines when handling Li and Li-ion batteries:

    A.  Keep batteries from contacting conductive materials, water, seawater, strong oxidizers, and strong acids

    B.  Do not place batteries in direct sunlight, on hot surfaces or in hot locations

    C.  Inspect batteries for signs of damage before use. Do not use batteries if there is any evidence of leakage or deformity. Never use and promptly and properly dispose of damaged or "puffy" batteries

    D.  Consult the SDS for precautions to use when handling leaking batteries.

    E.  Keep all flammable materials away from operating area

    F.  Allow time for cooling before charging a battery that is still warm from usage and refrain from using a battery that is still warm from charging

    G.  Turn off equipment if the battery becomes unexpectedly, or excessively hot. Wait for battery to cool before removing from equipment

    H.  Use batteries only for the application for which they were designed. Only use lithium cells and batteries in approved equipment

    I.  Keep batteries in their original packaging until ready for use

    J.  Use special care in handling batteries. Make sure they are not punctured, crushed, mishandled, disassembled or exposed to storage temperatures exceeding the maximum specified temperature on the product's safety data sheet

    K.  Remove jewelry items such as rings, wristwatches, pendants, etc., that could come in contact with the battery terminals

4.  **Storage**

    A.  Storage cabinets must conform to the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)  30 or equivalent: 18 gauge sheet steel, double wall, locked, and labeled with a list of contents. Maintain at least 2" clearance around the cabinet for ventilation and fire control

    B.  The cabinet location must be protected from forklifts, hand trucks, overhead loads, and other devices that could result in cell damage to the storage cabinet and the batteries while in storage

    C.  Cabinet should be isolated from flammable liquids and hazardous waste. No other hazardous or combustible material should be stored in or on the cabinet.

    D.  Label all storage cabinets with the applicable hazardous materials placard.

    E.  Storage areas with more than 5 pounds of metallic lithium must be labeled with the appropriate placard in accordance with NFPA 704 diamond that is at least 18" on each side with applicable information (e.g. Health 3, Flammability 2, Reactivity 2, and Special Hazard W); see Attachment A.

    F.  Remove batteries from device for long-term storage

    G.  Store batteries in a lithium safe guard or bag to prevent damage to other batteries in the case of fire or ignition

    H.  Store batteries in a cool, dry, and ventilated area

    I.  Store the batteries at temperatures between 5°C and 20°C (41°F and 68°F)

    J.  Separate fresh and depleted batteries/cells

    K.  Avoid bulk-storage in non-laboratory areas, such as offices

    L.  Visually inspect storage areas weekly

    M.  Maintain a binder of SDS pertaining to the specific batteries near the storage cabinets

5.  **Charging**

    Li batteries are grouped into two general categories: primary and secondary batteries. 

    -   **Primary batteries** consist of single-use cells containing metallic lithium anodes, are non-rechargeable and are commonly known as Li metal batteries

        -   NEVER charge a primary battery

        -   Store one time use (primary batteries) separately from secondary batteries; properly label the outer packaging to prevent this mistake

    -   **Secondary batteries** contain an intercalated Li compound for the anode and cathode. These batteries are rechargeable and are commonly referred to as Li-ion batteries

    Use the following guidelines when charging secondary batteries.

    a.  When applicable, use Lithium Polymer (LiPo) bags to charge batteries

    b.  Use only lithium-specific chargers to safely charge cells or battery packs

    c.  Charge secondary batteries to approximately 50% - 70% of capacity before long-term storage. Most chargers will have a designated "storage-mode" dependent on the voltage, type of battery, and how many cells it is

    d.  Disconnect batteries immediately if during operation or charging they:

        i.  Emit an unusual smell

        ii. Emit smoke

        iii. Overheat or become abnormally hot

        iv. The battery begins to swell

        v.  Behave abnormally

    e.  Do not leave batteries and chargers unattended during charging. Charging should be in a manned space or remotely monitored

    f.  Remove batteries from chargers promptly after charging is complete. Do not use the charger as a storage device/location

    g.  Do not parallel charge batteries of varying age and charge status

    h.  Check voltage before parallel charging. All batteries should be within 0.5 volts of each other

    i.  If a battery cannot maintain a charge for its normal duration, even when properly charged, remove the battery from service and dispose of properly

6.  **Shipping:**

    Federal regulations about shipping Li batteries are updated every year as new hazards are identified. Due to these yearly updates, this document will not provide specific shipping instructions. SWFSC personnel needing to ship Li batteries must take the appropriate International Aviation Transportation Association (IATA), International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG), or Department of Transportation (DOT) training, attend and update their training certification every 2 - 3 years, and provide a copy of the certificate to Marty Nelson, Safety Engineer, SECO. Trained personnel will also adhere to the Federal regulations that govern the specific mode of transportation to be used.

7.  **Disposal**

    a.  In California, Li-metal/ion batteries are considered hazardous waste and need to be disposed of properly. All Li batteries types (AAA, AA, C, D, button cell, 9-volt, etc), whether primary or secondary, must be recycled or taken to a household hazardous waste disposal facility, a universal waste handler (e.g., storage facility or broker), or an authorized recycling facility

    b.  Options for recycling

        i\. The Big Green Box (\$3.84/lb) <https://biggreenbox.com/products/lithium-metal-batteries1>

        ii\. Update Green (\$2.00/lb) <https://updategreen.com/>

        iii\. Secure E-Waste Solutions <https://www.sesrecycling.com/>

8.  **Emergency Response**

    A.  *Preventative Measures*

        Please follow the steps outlined below to ensure that any batteries showing signs of misuse are handled and disposed of properly. Proper PPE will be worn when taking preventative measures including a lab coat, rubber gloves, and safety glasses.

        i\. If batteries are showing evidence of thermal runaway failure, be very cautious; the gases may be flammable and toxic and failure modes can be hazardous

        ii\. Disconnect the battery (if possible)

        iii\. Remove the battery from the equipment/device (if possible)

        iv.  Place the battery in a metal or other container away from combustibles

    B.  *Fires*

        In the event that a Li metal or ion battery were to catch fire, a room could fill quickly with dense white smoke and the fire will be difficult to extinguish. The fumes and smoke from the fire can cause severe irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. All precautions must be taken to limit exposure to these fumes. The following actions should be taken:

        i\. Evacuate personnel from all areas affected by the smoke and fumes and sound the fire alarm

        ii\. Assess the scene for unsafe conditions for yourself and others

        iii\. Assist victim, determine extent of injury, and administer first aid if appropriate and you are trained

        iv\. Ventilate the affected areas and continue ventilation until the odor is no longer detected

        v\. Use a CO2 (Class BC) or dry chemical (Class ABC) fire extinguisher

        vi\. Don't use a Class D fire extinguisher 

        vii\. If possible, direct someone to call 9-911 for emergency response on one of the facility phones
